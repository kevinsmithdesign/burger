# burger

In this assignment, I created a burger logger using MySql, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Rules below:

• The restaurant app lets users input the name of burger they'd like to eat. 
• Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page.
• Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side   of the page.
• The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
